# ocd-builder

ocd-builder is a generic heml chart to s2i build your code in git into an container image. It can also add a docker tag to the built image that matches the git tag. This can be triggered by a git webhook configured to push an event to ocd-builder-webook. Together they implement this story for building:

```
Given a developer wants to create a release of an application 
When they create a git release $TAG of the code that matches a regular expression
Then an OCD webhook will catch the git webhook event and run an s2i build
And will apply $TAG to the built container image within the registry
```

Most people are familiar with `push` events that do CI builds. The event that we want to respond to is a `release` event. This is fired on any of:

 1. `hub release -m 'my release' v1.2.3`
 2. Using the web interface to create a release with a tag `v1.2.3`

This will fire a release webhook event and create a tag that you can pull from the server. What we want to do is make a container image of the code at tag `v1.2.3` and give it the docker tag `v1.2.3`. Then we can use the other features of OCD to move that tagged image to different environments. 

Many (if not the majority) of developers wonâ€™t be aware of the git release feature. There is a weaker definition of a release which is to push a release tag that matches some pattern (e.g., `/v.*/` or `/.*-RELEASE/`). That will generate a different type of webook event. You might not have noticed that there are three styles of git tags you can use: lightweight, annotated and signed. OCD plans to support all these release defintions. The OCD default has a few advantages so we suggest you create release if those are supported by you git server (e.g., GitHub, Gitea).
